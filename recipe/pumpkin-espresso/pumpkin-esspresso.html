    <p>Yossy Arefi was inspired by the classic PSL for her twist on our basic pumpkin pie recipe, and this is his recipe</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>Pumpkin Pie Base</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Espresso Cream Cheese</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on a baking sheet.</p></li>

        <li><p>Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl; mix until combined. Pour into the pie crust, leaving a bit of room at the top.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine cream cheese, granulated sugar, espresso powder, egg yolk, vanilla, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl; whisk until combined and smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dollop the cream cheese mixture over the pumpkin pie filling then use a toothpick or thin knife to swirl the cream cheese into the pumpkin.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool completely before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
